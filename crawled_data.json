    "content": "Climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health. It affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems \u2013 including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems. It is therefore a threat multiplier, undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress. As climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed, including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies.  Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) concluded that climate risks are appearing faster and will become more severe sooner than previously expected, and it will be harder to adapt with increased global heating. It further reveals that 3.6\u00a0billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Despite contributing minimally to global emissions, low-income countries and small island developing states (SIDS) endure the harshest health impacts. In vulnerable regions, the death rate from extreme weather events in the last decade was 15 times higher than in less vulnerable ones. Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations, and those with underlying health conditions.  Figure:\u00a0An overview of climate-sensitive health risks, their exposure pathways and vulnerability factors. Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly, and is strongly mediated by environmental, social and public health determinants. \u00a0 Although it is unequivocal that climate change affects human health, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the scale and impact of many climate-sensitive health risks. However, scientific advances progressively allow us to attribute an increase in morbidity and mortality to global warming, and more accurately determine the risks and scale of these health threats. WHO data indicates 2\u00a0billion people lack safe drinking water and 600\u00a0million suffer from foodborne illnesses annually, with children under 5 bearing 30% of foodborne fatalities. Climate stressors heighten waterborne and foodborne disease risks. In 2020, 770\u00a0million faced hunger, predominantly in Africa and Asia. Climate change affects food availability, quality and diversity, exacerbating food and nutrition crises. Temperature and precipitation changes enhance the spread of vector-borne diseases. Without preventive actions, deaths from such diseases, currently over 700 000 annually, may rise. Climate change induces both immediate mental health issues, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and long-term disorders due to factors like displacement and disrupted social cohesion. Recent research attributes 37% of heat-related deaths to human-induced climate change. Heat-related deaths among those over 65 have risen by 70% in two decades. In 2020, 98\u00a0million more experienced food insecurity compared to the 1981\u20132010 average. The WHO conservatively projects 250\u00a0000 additional yearly deaths by the 2030s due to climate change impacts on diseases like malaria and coastal flooding. However, modelling challenges persist, especially around capturing risks like drought and migration pressures. The climate crisis threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction, and to further widen existing health inequalities between and within populations. It severely jeopardizes the realization of UHC in various ways, including by compounding the existing burden of disease and by exacerbating existing barriers to accessing health services, often at the times when they are most needed. Over 930\u00a0million people \u2013 around 12% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 spend at least 10% of their household budget to pay for health care. With the poorest people largely uninsured, health shocks and stresses already currently push around 100 million people into poverty every\u00a0year, with the impacts of climate change worsening this trend. In the short- to medium-term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer-term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points. While no one is safe from these risks, the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis are the people who contribute least to its causes, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it: people in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities. Addressing climate change's health burden underscores the equity imperative: those most responsible for emissions should bear the highest mitigation and adaptation costs, emphasizing health equity and vulnerable group prioritization. To avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the world must limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Past emissions have already made a certain level of global temperature rise and other changes to the climate inevitable. Global heating of even 1.5\u00b0C is not considered safe, however; every additional tenth of a degree of warming will take a serious toll on people\u2019s lives and health. WHO\u2019s response to these challenges centres around 3 main objectives: Leadership and Raising Awareness: WHO leads in emphasizing climate change's health implications, aiming to centralize health in climate policies, including through the UNFCCC. Partnering with major health agencies, health professionals and civil society, WHO strives to embed climate change in health priorities like UHC and target carbon neutrality by 2030. Evidence and Monitoring: WHO, with its network of global experts, contributes global evidence summaries, provides assistance to nations in their assessments, and monitors progress. The emphasis is on deploying effective policies and enhancing access to knowledge and data. Capacity Building and Country Support: Through WHO offices, support is given to ministries of health, focusing on collaboration across sectors, updated guidance, hands-on training, and support for project preparation and execution as well as for securing climate and health funding.\u00a0 WHO leads the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH), bringing together a range of health and development partners, to support countries in achieving their commitments to climate-resilient and low carbon health systems.

    "content": "Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250\u00a0000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone. The direct damage costs to health are estimated to be between US$ 2\u20134 billion per year by 2030. Areas with weak health infrastructure \u2013 mostly in developing countries \u2013 will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.  Greenhouse gas emissions that result from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels are major contributors to both climate change and air pollution. Many policies and individual measures, such as transport, food and energy use choices, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce major health co-benefits, particularly by abating air pollution. The phase out of polluting energy systems, for example, or the promotion of public transportation and active movement, could both lower carbon emissions and cut the burden of household and ambient air pollution, which cause 7 million premature deaths per year Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues.

    "content": "Trending DataNon-communicable\n        diseases cause 70% of global\n        deaths  country dropdown The World Bank Group is committed to meeting the needs of developing countries with smart development solutions. We are supporting countries to build resilience to climate change so that they are less vulnerable and better prepared to withstand extreme weather.  We are also helping countries grow and create jobs while minimizing their emissions.    Development progress has stalled in many countries amid low growth, increased fragility and conflict, pandemic-related setbacks, and the impacts of climate change. An essential part of our vision to end poverty on a livable planet is helping people and communities adapt and prepare for the unpredictable and life-changing weather patterns they are experiencing.\u00a0 Droughts, extreme heat, flooding and storms push millions into poverty annually, causing unemployment and risking unplanned internal and cross-border migration. Every year, an estimated 26 million people fall into poverty due to extreme weather events and natural disasters. These shocks have the potential to push a total of 130 million into poverty by 2030. We are supporting countries to meet these challenges in a way that builds resilience across families, communities, and companies, and doesn\u2019t inadvertently increase pollution. Helping people and communities adapt means making development investments that improve quality of life while also creating local jobs, strengthening education, and promoting economic stability. It also ensures that limited development resources are used wisely\u2014by building infrastructure that can withstand future disasters, rather than needing to be rebuilt after each one. The World Bank Group is committed to meeting the needs of its clients \u2013 developing countries \u2013 who are asking our projects to have climate benefits, seeing it as smart development for their unique situations.\u00a0This is a practical approach that opens the door to every resource at our disposal\u2014bringing in industries and investors across the spectrum to participate. It creates opportunities, ensuring that no one is left out of the solutions we need for a more sustainable future.\u00a0 This means building hospitals that can withstand natural disasters and roads that don't get washed away with rainfall. Countries are investing in resource efficient rice harvests, heat-resistant varieties of seeds, drip irrigation, and restoring forests and mangroves to protect rural and coastal communities, improve their food security, and identify new private sector opportunities that will create jobs. We are supporting reliable and affordable energy, boosting utility efficiency, and increasing regional power integration. We are also investing in country priorities \u2013 for example, improving affordable and efficient public transportation to get people back and forth to work, or improving on-farm productivity with new varieties of seeds and healthier livestock. Last Updated:\u00a0Apr 28, 2025 Strategy The World Bank Group is committed to meeting the needs of developing countries with smart development solutions. We are guided by our Board-approved Climate Change Action Plan 2020-2025 (CCAP), which lays out our goals of supporting adaptation and mitigation, our diagnostic tools to help countries with analytics related to climate change and development, and our commitment to align financing flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement to support countries\u2019 climate commitments. The CCAP has been extended until June 30, 2026, with no other changes. To respond to increasing client demands, the Bank is directing 45% of its financing to development projects with strong climate co-benefits, with the goal of half to projects with adaptation benefits and half with mitigation benefits in IBRD/IDA operations.\u00a0 Adaptation builds resilience with durable roads, flood-resistant infrastructure, and water-efficient irrigation. Simple, cost-effective solutions\u2014like improving drainage systems or using drought-resistant seeds\u2014deliver outsized impact.\u00a0 Mitigation cuts emissions. It is about helping countries grow and create jobs while minimizing their emissions.\u00a0\u00a0 It means investing in a mix of energy sources as part of a practical energy future, and extends beyond energy to sectors like agriculture, where better practices can cut methane, and transportation, where shifting freight from roads to rail can lower carbon footprints, and water and waste. Smart development is an essential element of a more prosperous and healthier world. Through targeted support, we can help countries thrive, using new technologies that are more effective and efficient, while reducing poverty and building a cleaner planet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Activities The World Bank Group delivered a $42.6 billion in smart development finance that had climate co-benefits in fiscal year 2024\u2014which covers July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024. In 2024, we partnered with other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to launch a common approach for measuring resilience outcomes in a more systematic way. This approach pivots from mostly measuring the volume of our finance with climate co-benefits, to also measuring results. In addition to the current practice of disclosing climate finance (mitigation and adaptation) data for each project, the World Bank is disclosing\u00a0sub-project\u00a0level climate finance data, from April 1, 2025.\u00a0 The World Bank will also disclose climate finance at the close of each project which could facilitate comparison between committed and disbursed amounts. This enhanced transparency measure will be effective from July 1, 2025 (the start of fiscal year 2026).\u00a0 Our analytics include the Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs), with over 60 published to date covering 74 economies. Countries are tapping into our vast stores of development knowledge to gain expertise, especially in strengthening the enabling environment for private sector investment and supporting smart development in their local communities and local businesses. Since 2008, we have issued approximately $19 billion\u00a0equivalent\u00a0through over 220 labeled (green, blue) bonds in 28 currencies. We have also engineered new instruments, whether issuing the Bank\u2019s first sustainability linked loan to Uruguay to improve livestock productivity and decrease their footprint, or developing new instruments including outcome-based bonds or guarantees that have supported carbon markets. We are working with over 30 countries in establishing domestic carbon pricing mechanisms and preparing for the next generation of international carbon markets. We are also helping countries to design and implement large scale programs that generate high integrity carbon credits in the forests and other sectors. And we are supporting nature-based solutions to development challenges such as using soil stabilization to reduce erosion, and mangrove restoration to improve fisheries and protect coastal infrastructure from wave inundation. The World Bank currently has over\u00a0$14 billion active investments\u00a0in environment, natural resources, and the ocean. Efforts like Mission 300 help align private capital with public priorities to achieve results neither could accomplish alone. Philanthropies and development banks provide the financial backbone; countries take the lead on project conception and implementation. As part of a\u00a0blueprint for methane reduction, through the Global Methane Reduction Platform For Development (CH4D) platform we are supporting 24 country-led programs to deliver better rice production, livestock operations and waste management systems with methane reduction, enhanced environmental resilience and improved livelihoods. We have significantly expanded our crisis toolkit in several ways: broadening the scope of our\u00a0Climate Resilient Debt Clauses\u00a0to now cover disasters such as droughts, floods, and pandemics, offering vulnerable countries much-needed financial flexibility during crises.
